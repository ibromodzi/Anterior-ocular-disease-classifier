# Anterior-ocular-disease-classifier
The Anterior Ocular Disease Classifier is a program developed using PyTorch that aims to differentiate between images of ocular disorders, specifically anterior uveitis and conjunctivitis. This README provides an overview of the project, its functionality, and instructions on how to use and contribute to it.

# Introduction
Ocular diseases such as anterior uveitis and conjunctivitis require accurate and timely diagnosis for effective treatment. The Anterior Ocular Disease # Classifier utilizes deep learning techniques implemented in PyTorch to automate the classification process. By analyzing ocular images, the program aims to accurately differentiate between these two common ocular disorders.
